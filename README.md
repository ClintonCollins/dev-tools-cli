# Dev Tools CLI

This is a very simple tool that allows me to quickly automate tasks that I do often.

## Commands

### `encode webp`
Recursively converts all images in the specified directory and its subdirectories to webp format. Outputs them to your
specified output directory.

### `generate key`
Generates a random key of the specified amount of bytes.


## Requirements
If you're using the `encode webp` command, you'll need to have the `cwebp` binary installed. You can get it from
[here](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/download).
